# Analysis of data about online cinema customers - data description, analysis, and linear regression model construction


***STATUS:*** **Completed**


## Project Goal:

The main goal of the project is to build a linear regression model to predict the average user rating based on the set of movie genres.

## Project Description:

The primary source of information is a dataset containing information about cinema customers. The goal of the data project is to create a recommendation system with an accuracy of 15% based on the data provided by our dataset. If the project is successful and the recommendation system works with 15% accuracy, the Customer Retention Rate (the ability of a company or product to retain customers over a specified period) will increase, affecting the service's profitability.

## Research Conclusion:

The linear regression model produces excellent results with a mean squared error of 0.020 on the training set and 0.029 on the test set.

## Use of Research Results:

The results allow us to successfully implement a recommendation system in the streaming service.


## Technical Features of the Project:

Data is cleaned from duplicates (explicit and implicit) - preprocessing is carried out.
Grouping of data in various cross-sections was used to answer research questions.
